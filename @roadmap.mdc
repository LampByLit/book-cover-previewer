# BOOK COVER PREVIEWER - Comprehensive Roadmap & Strategy

## Executive Summary
Transform the existing MIXTAPE HYPERBOREA 3D book previewer into a BOOK COVER PREVIEWER that allows users to upload custom cover art with dynamic trim sizes. The application will maintain the professional 3D visualization while enabling user-generated content with persistent storage and automated cleanup.

## Development Methodology
**BUILD CAREFULLY AND METHODICALLY, STEP BY STEP**

This project will be developed with meticulous attention to detail, following a structured, incremental approach:

### Core Principles
- **No rushing**: Each phase must be thoroughly tested before proceeding
- **Complete verification**: Every feature must work perfectly before moving forward
- **Incremental commits**: Push after every significant update for immediate feedback

- **Test-driven development**: Verify functionality at each step

### Development Process
1. **Plan thoroughly** before implementing any feature
2. **Implement incrementally** with small, testable changes
3. **Test immediately** after each implementation
4. **Commit and push** after successful testing
5. **Document changes** clearly in commit messages
6. **Review progress** before starting the next phase

### Quality Gates
- All code must pass linting
- All features must work as expected
- No regressions in existing functionality

### Key Technical Challenges

#### Dynamic UV Mapping
**Challenge:** Current system uses fixed UV coordinates for 5"×8" books with 0.842" spine
**Solution:**
1. Calculate UV offsets based on trim size proportions
2. Update texture repeat/offset values dynamically
3. Maintain bleed handling for different spine widths
4. Test edge cases with extreme trim size ratios

#### Railway Volume Integration
**Challenge:** Serverless environment with persistent storage requirements
**Solution:**
1. Use Railway volume mounts for file storage
2. Implement atomic file operations
3. Add cleanup scheduling via Railway cron
4. Handle storage quota and error conditions

#### Cross-Browser File Upload
**Challenge:** Drag-and-drop and File API inconsistencies
**Solution:**
1. Implement progressive enhancement
2. Add fallback for browsers without drag-and-drop
3. Use modern File API with feature detection
4. Test thoroughly across target browsers

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk
1. **UV Mapping Complexity** (Impact: High, Probability: Medium)
   - *Mitigation:* Start with one preset size, validate thoroughly before expanding

2. **Railway Volume Reliability** (Impact: High, Probability: Low)
   - *Mitigation:* Implement local storage fallback, extensive error handling

3. **3D Performance with Dynamic Sizes** (Impact: Medium, Probability: Medium)
   - *Mitigation:* Performance testing early, implement LOD system if needed

### Medium Risk
4. **File Upload Edge Cases** (Impact: Medium, Probability: High)
   - *Mitigation:* Comprehensive validation, user-friendly error messages

5. **Mobile Responsiveness** (Impact: Low, Probability: Medium)
   - *Mitigation:* Mobile-first design approach, extensive testing
